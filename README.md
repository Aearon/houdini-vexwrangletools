houdini-vexwrangletools
=======================

A collection of convinience methods that make  houdini 12.5's wrangle sops easier and more pleasant to work with.

Currently only contains one method: 

```
def literalsToParms(nodes):
    """For each node in nodes that has a snippet parameter (e.g. all the wrangle
    sops):
    
    Adds a parameter for each variable declared in the code, if that variable
    is just assigned a literal. The declaration itself is changed so it
    references the created parameter.

    e.g. if somewhere in your snippet, you have the line
    
    vector normal = {1,2,3};

    a float parameter named 'normal' with 3 components will be created on the
    node, with it's default set to 1,2,3. The line in the code will be changed
    to:
    
    vector normal = ch("normal");

    Currently only works with float, vector, vector4 and int parameters

    If the method is run on a node that already has these auto-generated 
    parameters, it'll updated them:
    
    * change the parameter type if the variable's type has changed in the code
    * change the number of components if it has changed in the code
    * delete parameters who's corresponding declaration has been removed
    * update default values

    The parameters are created at the top of the parameter interface,
    with a separator below. The separator is called 'auto_generated'. All
    parameters above this separator are considered to have been generated by
    this script and are fair game for deletion when running the script again.
    """
